# Send a stream of items to Redis as PubSub events

This module will take in objects or strings as a [stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html), and send it to [Redis](http://redis.io/) as a [pubsub](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub) message.

## Install

npm install redis-pubsub-stream

## Configuration

The RedisPubsubStream constructor should be passed an opts object as its argument, similar to the following:

    var opts = { 
          channel:"Test" 
        , serverAddress: "localhost" 
        , serverPort:6379 
        , redisOpts: {} 
      }

Where `channel` is the name of the channel to publish messages, `serverAddress` is the address of Redis server, and `port` is the port on which the Redis server is listening.

The `redisOpts` field contains any options to pass to the Redis constructor, which are listed in the [documentation for the node_redis module](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis#rediscreateclientport-host-options)

## Usage

For each incoming message, this module will output a corresponding pubsub message, on the specified channel, sent to the specified Redis instance.

This example (based on one of the test cases) reads in a json file with an array of items, parses them, and sends each items to the pubsub stream. 

    var RedisPubsubStream = require('redis-pubsub-stream')
      , fs = require('fs')
      , path = require('path')

    var inFile = path.join('test', 'input', 'simpleData.json')
      , opts = { 
          channel:"simplePubsubTest" 
        , serverAddress: "localhost" 
        , serverPort:6379 
        , redisOpts: {}
      }

    var pubsubStream = new RedisPubsubStream(opts)

    fs.readFile(inFile, function (err, data) {
      if (err) throw err
      data = JSON.parse(data)
      for(var i=0; i<data.length; i++){
        pubsubStream.write(data[i]);
      }
    })

Rather than sending items with .write(), a more typical example may simply pipe several streams together. The following example reads from a file, `data.txt`, parses the text using [regexStream](https://github.com/ornl-situ/regex-stream), and sends the parsed output to a Redis pubsub channel:

    var RedisPubsubStream = require('redis-pubsub-stream')
      , RegexStream = require('regex-stream')
      , util = require('util')

    var input = require('fs').createReadStream('./data.txt', {encoding:'utf-8'})
      , parser = {
          "regex": "^([\\S]+) ([\\S]+) ([\\S]+)"
        , "labels": ["A label", "B label", "C label"]
        , "delimiter": "\r\n|\n"
      }
      , regexStream = new RegexStream(parser)

    var opts = { channel:"simplePubsubTest" 
        , serverAddress: "localhost" 
        , serverPort:6379 
        , redisOpts: {} }

    var pubsubStream = new RedisPubsubStream(opts)

    // pipe data from input file to the regexStream parser to redis pubsub
    input.pipe(regexStream)
    regexStream.pipe(pubsubStream)

See the test cases for some usage examples.

## Development

If you are going to do development, you may want to use the [git pre-commit hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), which will check the `redis-pubsub-stream.js` file using [jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) script (if you have it installed) and run the [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) tests (mocha is in the node_modules directory). If either of these fail, the commit wont work. To use the hook, from project directory, run:

    ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
